# Usability Testing Plan for Order Payments Module

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the methodology and implementation plan for conducting usability testing on the Order Payments Module. The goal is to identify potential UX improvements, validate design decisions, and ensure a seamless user experience across all components of the module.

## 2. Testing Objectives

- Evaluate the overall user journey through the payment process
- Identify pain points in the ordering and payment workflows
- Assess the clarity of payment status and order information
- Validate the responsiveness of the interface across different devices
- Measure user satisfaction with the payment process
- Identify opportunities for UX improvements

## 3. Participant Profiles

### Target Users

We will recruit 8-10 participants from the following user segments:

1. **Frequent Online Shoppers (3-4 participants)**
   - Age range: 25-45
   - Makes online purchases at least once a week
   - Comfortable with different payment methods

2. **Occasional Users (2-3 participants)**
   - Age range: 30-60
   - Makes online purchases once a month or less
   - Varying levels of technical proficiency

3. **Small Business Owners (2-3 participants)**
   - Age range: 30-55
   - Regularly places business-related orders
   - Needs detailed documentation for accounting purposes

4. **Accessibility Users (1-2 participants)**
   - Users with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments
   - Users who rely on assistive technologies

## 4. Testing Methodology

### 4.1 Testing Approach

We will use a combination of:

- **Moderated In-Person Testing**: For detailed observation and follow-up questions
- **Remote Moderated Testing**: Using screen sharing software to accommodate participants from different locations
- **Unmoderated Remote Testing**: Using our custom UsabilityFeedback component for self-guided scenarios

### 4.2 Testing Environment

- Test across multiple devices: desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Use both high-speed and throttled network connections to simulate real-world conditions
- Test with multiple browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

## 5. Test Scenarios

### 5.1 Core User Flows

1. **Viewing Order History**
   - Navigate to orders list
   - Filter and sort orders
   - Identify orders by status

2. **Placing a New Order**
   - Create a new order
   - Add items and details
   - Review order summary before payment

3. **Payment Processing**
   - Select payment method
   - Enter payment details
   - Complete payment
   - View confirmation

4. **Order Tracking**
   - Track order status
   - View delivery timeline
   - Receive and view notifications

5. **Handling Issues**
   - Identify a problem with an order
   - Navigate to resolution center
   - Submit a dispute or request

### 5.2 Specific Component Tests

1. **OrderDetailCard Component**
   - Assess information hierarchy
   - Test expandable sections
   - Verify responsiveness

2. **PaymentSummary Component**
   - Verify clarity of cost breakdown
   - Test payment option selection
   - Check error handling for invalid inputs

3. **OrderTimeline Component**
   - Test clarity of status progression
   - Verify visibility of important dates
   - Check accessibility of timeline information

4. **DeliveryFileUploader Component**
   - Test file selection and upload process
   - Verify progress indicators
   - Check error handling for failed uploads

## 6. Data Collection Methods

### 6.1 Quantitative Metrics

- **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of users who complete tasks successfully
- **Time on Task**: Time taken to complete each task
- **Error Rate**: Number of errors encountered during task completion
- **SUS Score**: System Usability Scale questionnaire results
- **User Satisfaction Rating**: Post-task satisfaction ratings (1-5 scale)

### 6.2 Qualitative Feedback

- **Think-Aloud Protocol**: Participants verbalize thoughts during testing
- **Post-Task Interviews**: Structured questions about specific experiences
- **Feedback Component Responses**: In-app feedback collected during testing

## 7. Testing Tools and Implementation

### 7.1 Testing Components

The following custom components will be used to facilitate testing and collect data:

- **UsabilityFeedback**: In-app component for collecting immediate feedback
- **InteractionRecorder**: Component that tracks user clicks, navigation, and time spent
- **UserJourneyTracker**: Records the full user flow through scenarios
- **AccessibilityScanner**: Automated tool to check accessibility standards compliance

### 7.2 Integration

- Testing components will be conditionally rendered in development/testing environments
- Data will be collected in a separate testing database
- Components will not affect performance in production builds

## 8. Analysis and Reporting

- Compile quantitative metrics into usability scorecards for each component
- Create heat maps of user interaction patterns
- Identify critical incidents that prevented task completion
- Categorize feedback by severity and impact
- Develop actionable recommendations for UX improvements

## 9. Timeline and Resources

### 9.1 Testing Schedule

- **Preparation Phase**: 1 week (component development, recruitment)
- **Testing Phase**: 2 weeks (conduct sessions)
- **Analysis Phase**: 1 week (compile results, develop recommendations)
- **Implementation Phase**: 2-3 weeks (apply UX improvements)

### 9.2 Required Resources

- Testing facilitator
- Note-taker/observer
- Incentives for participants
- Recording equipment/software
- Analysis tools

## 10. Deliverables

- Usability testing report with findings and recommendations
- Prioritized list of UX improvements
- Annotated user journey maps highlighting pain points
- Video highlights of critical usability issues
- Updated component designs addressing identified issues

## Appendix: Test Script

A detailed test script with specific tasks and questions for each scenario will be created separately.
