# Order Payments Integration Guidelines

This file contains the specific guidelines and rules for implementing the order and payments integration functionality.

üöÄ High-Level Goal

We want to build a new, independent module named Order Management & Payments, inspired by Fiverr‚Äôs clean and user-friendly timeline design and workflow.

This module should handle the following clearly and logically:
	‚Ä¢	Tracking order statuses and progress (from initial order to completion and review)
	‚Ä¢	Providing a detailed view of orders (timeline of activities, order details like a ticket)
	‚Ä¢	Documenting deliveries (images, files, service documentation)
	‚Ä¢	Handling payments flexibly (holding funds, escrow, partial payments, refunds)
	‚Ä¢	Providing integrated support and FAQ management (Resolution Center)

‚∏ª

üìÇ Working Structure
	‚Ä¢	Important:
Build everything inside a new, separate folder (e.g., /order-payments-module) within our existing codebase, isolated clearly from current files to ensure our existing functionality remains intact and unaffected by potential errors during development.
	‚Ä¢	Why?
This ensures clean integration later and prevents disruption to our already stable, live code.

üìå What We‚Äôre Building (Features & Workflow)

The Order & Payment flow should mirror Fiverr‚Äôs logic and user experience. Clearly, this will include:

1. Order Lifecycle (Timeline view)

Create a clear, chronological timeline for each order showing:
	‚Ä¢	Order Placed
	‚Ä¢	Order Started (provider confirmation)
	‚Ä¢	Delivery Date Updates (when deadlines change)
	‚Ä¢	Order Delivered (provider uploads proof of work)
	‚Ä¢	Order Completed (user acceptance)
	‚Ä¢	Mutual Reviews (user and provider leave feedback)

‚∏ª

2. Order Details Page (‚ÄúTicket-like‚Äù Display)

This visually appealing, minimalistic overview should show clearly:
	‚Ä¢	Order ID (unique identifier)
	‚Ä¢	Ordered service title, image, and short description
	‚Ä¢	Provider‚Äôs name and contact (with a link to profile)
	‚Ä¢	Timeline dates clearly defined
	‚Ä¢	Billing summary and history (price breakdown, payment method)

‚∏ª

3. Delivery Documentation (Dedicated tab)

Clearly organize documentation and images from both client and provider in one easy-to-follow tab:
	‚Ä¢	User-Provided Content: Images/files describing the service request
	‚Ä¢	Provider-Provided Content: Progress evidence, delivery proof, documentation, final deliverables

‚∏ª

4. Payment Integration (Stripe, Flexible Payments)

Integrate Stripe for flexible payment scenarios clearly and robustly:
	‚Ä¢	Escrow-like functionality: Payment is collected and securely held until completion.
	‚Ä¢	Partial payments: Allow funds to be partially released at defined milestones.
	‚Ä¢	Refund logic: Clearly handle refunds or disputes through the Resolution Center.
	‚Ä¢	Integrate payments in a clear and secure manner using Stripe‚Äôs standard best practices (no detailed technical code needed here, just Stripe‚Äôs recommended flow).

‚∏ª

5. Reviews & Ratings Integration

Upon order completion:
	‚Ä¢	Clearly notify both user and provider to leave reviews.
	‚Ä¢	Reviews clearly displayed on profiles and order details page.

‚∏ª

6. FAQ & Resolution Center

Include clearly defined support and issue-resolution functionality:
	‚Ä¢	FAQs: Clearly documented answers to common payment/order questions.
	‚Ä¢	Resolution Center: Allow easy dispute management related to payments or delivery issues, clearly tied to specific orders.

‚∏ª

üõ†Ô∏è Integration with Existing App (Clearly defined boundaries)

Because the existing app has clear management, authentication, notifications, and file storage established, integrate them logically as follows:
	‚Ä¢	Authentication (Firebase Auth):
	‚Ä¢	Continue using the existing authentication (Firebase Auth). No new auth setup is required‚Äîclearly integrate using existing user sessions.
	‚Ä¢	Notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging):
	‚Ä¢	Clearly use our existing notification service (Firebase Cloud Messaging) to trigger user notifications related to orders (e.g., status updates, payment reminders, reviews).
	‚Ä¢	File Storage (Firebase Storage):
	‚Ä¢	Clearly use our current Firebase Storage system to manage file uploads related to orders (delivery proof, documents, images).
	‚Ä¢	Database (Firestore):
	‚Ä¢	Clearly create new collections or subcollections (cleanly separated from current ones) in Firestore specifically for managing orders, payments, order events, and resolution tickets.

‚∏ª

üåê Infrastructure & Deployment
	‚Ä¢	Clearly maintain our existing deployment workflow:
	‚Ä¢	Firebase hosting for frontend.
	‚Ä¢	Node.js (Express) backend server deployed as usual.
	‚Ä¢	Any new API endpoints for orders/payments created should be logically separated (e.g., /api/orders/*) and clearly documented.

‚∏ª

üé® Frontend Guidelines
	‚Ä¢	Continue using React with MUI, Radix UI, custom components, and Tailwind CSS to match existing styling clearly.
	‚Ä¢	New components for the Order Timeline, Order Details, and Delivery Tab should clearly follow existing UI guidelines to maintain design consistency.

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Summary of Clear Deliverables

Your AI software engineer should clearly deliver:
	‚Ä¢	A clearly separate, organized Order & Payment module folder (order-payments-module).
	‚Ä¢	Clean integration logic clearly documented (but separated from existing app code until ready).
	‚Ä¢	Clearly organized Firestore collections dedicated to order/payment data.
	‚Ä¢	Stripe payments integrated following clear best practices.
	‚Ä¢	Clear usage of existing authentication, notification, and storage systems (Firebase ecosystem).
	‚Ä¢	Clearly documented README.md file explaining integration points, API structure, and module usage.

‚∏ª

üìÖ Next Steps (Recommended)
	‚Ä¢	Begin with clearly defining the Firestore data structures for orders, payments, and events.
	‚Ä¢	Establish the clear API endpoints structure for the Order and Payment logic.
	‚Ä¢	Clearly set up and test Stripe integration in a sandbox environment.
	‚Ä¢	Develop clear frontend components to visually replicate the Fiverr workflow logic clearly and intuitively.
	‚Ä¢	Clearly document integration points with existing Firebase systems for auth, storage, and notifications.
