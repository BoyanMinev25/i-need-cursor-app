# Order Payments Module - Production Deployment Guidelines

This document outlines the step-by-step process for deploying the Order Payments module to production. Follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth integration with the main application.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All features are fully implemented according to the `implementation-todo.md` file
- [ ] All integration points are properly configured as specified in `integration-guidelines.md`
- [ ] All tests are passing (unit, integration, and end-to-end)
- [ ] Performance testing results meet or exceed benchmarks
- [ ] Security audit has been completed (especially for payment processing)
- [ ] Stripe integration is fully tested in test mode
- [ ] All environment variables are properly configured
- [ ] Documentation is complete and up-to-date

## Deployment Process

### 1. Database Migration

```bash
# Run the database migration script to create required collections and indexes
npm run migrate:orders
```

This script will:
- Create the necessary Firestore collections
- Set up indexes for efficient queries
- Add security rules for the new collections

### 2. Backend Deployment

```bash
# Deploy backend services
npm run deploy:api
```

This will:
- Deploy Node.js functions for order management
- Set up API endpoints for Stripe integration
- Configure webhooks for payment event handling

### 3. Frontend Integration

```bash
# Build and prepare the module for integration
npm run build:module
```

This creates an optimized bundle that can be imported into the main application.

### 4. Main Application Integration

1. Install the module in the main application:

```bash
# From the main application root
npm install --save ./order-payments-module
```

2. Update the main application's routing:

```javascript
// In the main application's routing configuration
import { OrderRoutes } from 'order-payments-module';

// Add order routes to the main router
<Routes>
  {/* Existing routes */}
  <Route path="/orders/*" element={<OrderRoutes />} />
</Routes>
```

3. Add navigation links in the main application:

```javascript
// Example: Add to user dashboard or navigation menu
<NavLink to="/orders">Orders & Payments</NavLink>
```

### 5. Stripe Production Configuration

1. Update Stripe API keys to production:

```bash
# Set production environment variables
firebase functions:config:set stripe.key="sk_live_XXXXXXXXXX"
firebase functions:config:set stripe.webhook_secret="whsec_XXXXXXXXXX"
```

2. Validate Stripe webhook configuration is pointing to the production endpoint.

### 6. Testing in Production Environment

Perform a controlled rollout:

1. Deploy to a staging environment that mirrors production
2. Conduct a full test cycle with real but controlled transactions
3. Monitor logs and error reporting systems
4. Test the entire order lifecycle from creation to completion

### 7. Monitoring & Alerting Setup

```bash
# Deploy monitoring configuration
npm run deploy:monitoring
```

This will set up:
- Error alerting for critical payment failures
- Performance monitoring dashboards
- Transaction logging for audit purposes
- Stripe webhook monitoring

### 8. Final Production Deployment

```bash
# Full production deployment
npm run deploy:production
```

This command:
- Deploys all components to production
- Enables the module for all users
- Activates monitoring and alerting

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues after deployment:

```bash
# Execute rollback
npm run rollback:orders
```

This will:
- Disable the Order Payments routes
- Revert to the previous stable state
- Maintain data integrity

## Post-Deployment Tasks

- [ ] Monitor error logs for the first 48 hours intensively
- [ ] Watch for payment processing success rates
- [ ] Verify webhook delivery and processing
- [ ] Conduct sample test transactions
- [ ] Check database query performance
- [ ] Update the CHANGELOG.md with the deployment details
- [ ] Schedule a review meeting after 1 week of deployment

## Support & Maintenance

### Support Contacts

- **Payment Processing Issues**: Stripe Dashboard + Alert System
- **Order Management Issues**: Firebase Logs + Monitoring Dashboard
- **Integration Issues**: Application Error Tracking

### Regular Maintenance

Schedule regular maintenance checks:
- Weekly review of transaction logs
- Monthly review of Stripe fees and reconciliation
- Quarterly security audits of payment flows

## Compliance & Legal

Ensure compliance with:
- PCI DSS requirements for payment processing
- Data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- Terms of service updates for payment processing
